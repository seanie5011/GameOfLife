# GameOfLife

A project where Conways Game of Life is implemented. This is done in `C++` using `SFML 2.6.0`, with the `mingw32` compiler.

## Installing and running

1. Ensure `SFML 2.6.0` has been installed and statically linked.
2. Navigate to the desired implementations directory and open a terminal.
3. Type `mingw32-make all` to create an executable.
4. Open the executable.

## Implementation

This uses the method as discussed in [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain)'s video [*Coding Challenge #85: The Game of Life*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSR_7kZuYg&t=1267s&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain).
